                <p>Monchel Sharp is a lighthearted, loving and joyous individual, who at the age of 22 made the life shifting decision to choose herself over the painful challenging circumstances presented by life. By making the decision, Monchel was able to tap into her potential to unlock the keys to the Kingdom, reclaiming her power and ability to respond to life with a calm mind.</p>

                <p>Studying the Kingdom teachings of the Book of Life and Dr. Myles Munroe, Monchel discovered her purpose for living, which was affirmed by continued mindset sharpening through studying the likes of John C. Maxwell, Parnell M. Lovelace Jr., Norman Vincent Peale, Iyanla Vanzant and Les Brown. For nearly a decade, she has committed to empowering and teaching individuals to recognize their equipping, in order to transition through [challenges and change] and live life with freedom.</p>

                <p>“I said to myself, this pain doesn't belong to me, so therefore it isn't mine to live… everyone deserves that freedom. I believe my purpose is to empower - by revealing potential. Then, to inspire use of that potential - allowing for control over one's own life.”</p>

                <p>While operating in a mindset of abundance, Monchel had the pleasure of being mentored by prominent mindset coach Jon Talarico “The Connector”, which lead to the opportunity to be coached and mentored by one of the world's greatest and influential motivational speakers, Mr. Les Brown. Monchel's inspirational and relatable speaking style landed her an international speaking opportunity on Les Brown's and Jon Talarico's Power Voice Summit.</p>

                <p>Currently, in addition to speaking engagements and coaching, Monchel is preparing subsequent material, as she is a proponent of learning through multiple modalities.</p>
